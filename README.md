# Nathaniel Smith Portfolio Website
A website I designed and developed for a python engineer to showcase his work. I built this site with React.js and Sass. I lightly adapted [this](https://codepen.io/tonkotsuboy/pen/zJbKNN) codepen for use as a backgorund on the site.

You can visit the site [here](https://nathanielsmith.xyz).
